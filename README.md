# iqtoolkit
Toolkit for building LINQ IQueryable providers. This is the official move of my IQToolkit project from CodePlex. 

IQToolkit is essential if you are building your own LINQ IQueryable provider. It contains common tools and source code 
you can apply to your own project.

In the toolkit you will find useful techniques for manipulating LINQ expression trees, implementing IQueryable providers, 
and a host of extensible components for building providers that target translation of LINQ expressions into SQL like languages.
